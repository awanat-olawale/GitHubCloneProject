# 1.Clone a GitHub Repository and Add New Content

## Objective: 
Familiarize yourself with the process of cloning an existing repository from GitHub, adding new content to it, and pushing the changes back to GitHub.

### Skills Practiced:

- Cloning a repository from GitHub
- Editing files and committing changes in a Git-enabled directory
- Pushing updates to a remote repository

#### Expected outcome:
*Your GitHub repository GitHubCloneProject will now include a greetings.txt file with the specified content. This demonstrates your ability to clone a repository, make changes locally, and push those changes back to the remote repository.

#### Notes:

- This project reinforces the concept of remote repositories and introduces you to managing and updating project content after cloning it from GitHub. 
- Remember to replace <REPOSITORY-URL> with your repository’s actual URL provided by GitHub.

#### Repo:

**GitHub repository: GitHubCloneProject
File: greetings.txt, README.md

# 2.Branching, Making Changes, and Resolving Merge Conflicts

## Objective: 
Practice creating branches for feature development, merging branches, and resolving merge conflicts to simulate a common collaborative workflow on Git and GitHub.

### Skills Practiced:

- Branching and navigating between branches
- Making changes in different branches and committing those changes
- Merging branches and resolving conflicts

#### Expected outcome:

*You will have successfully created a new feature branch, made changes in both the feature-greeting and main branches, and resolved a merge conflict resulting from attempting to merge these branches. Your GitHubCloneProject repository on GitHub will reflect these changes and the merge resolution.

#### Notes:

-This project simulates a collaborative scenario where changes made in different branches can lead to conflicts. It tests your ability to manage branches, navigate merge conflicts, and maintain a clean project history.
- Replace <REPOSITORY-URL> with your repository’s actual URL.

#### Repo:

**GitHub repository: GitHubCloneProject
File: feature.txt, README.md
